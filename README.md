# What is this game?

So this is a classic arcade styled fixed shooter game, where you play as an exterminator, who sprays wasps by blowing smoke rings. The player character is located at the bottom of the screen and the wasps come from the top of the screen to hit him. While the player is standing still, they can blow smoke rings, which will exterminate the wasps when they get hit. The smoke rings expand as they go up. The bigger they are, the more wasps they can take out, and the more wasps one of them takes out, the more score you will get from each wasp.

However, the player also needs to dodge obstacles that they can't get rid of, so they won't be able to just stand still all the time, so the challenge is to deal with both the wasps and the obstacles at the same time while not getting hit by anything.

There are 4 rounds to beat in this game. If the player gets hit, the round will restart, and you'll lose the score you gained from the start of the round. When there are now more wasps or obstacles left, The score you gained will be counted, and you'll go to the next round.

# About my experience making this game

This game was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2025 under 96 hours. This is my second time participating in this game jam, or in any game jam for that matter. Last year I had a very good experience joining a game jam for the first time. Since then, I tried to work on the things I struggled with, So that I'll be able to make an improvment next time.

While making the game this year, I tried to keep the criticism and tips I received last year in mind, to hopefully help more people enjoy my game this time. To be honest, I think I did manage to improve most of what I was lacking in last year's game jam, but the idea I went with this year didn't really "click with me" like the one from last year. The idea seemed good when I described it to my self, but when I started implementing it, I realized that I'll need to add and change some mechanics to make this game into a fun and unique challenge. From my own play testing, I THINK the game ended up being fun, but I can't be sure until I hear what other people have to say.

# No Sound?

So unfortunately, I didn't manage to get to adding sound to my game during the time I had to work on it. I won't go into the specific reasons for why I think that happened, but let's just say that some things didn't really go as I intended. This is the only thing I got criticism for last year that I didn't manage to improve, so I'll definitely be keeping this in mind for the next time I join a game jam.
